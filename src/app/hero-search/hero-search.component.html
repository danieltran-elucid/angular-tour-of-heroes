  <!-- As the user types in the search box, an input event binding calls the component's search() method with the new search box value. -->
  <!-- Every time the user types in the textbox, the binding calls search() with the textbox value, a "search term". The searchTerms becomes an Observable emitting a steady stream of search terms. -->

    <!-- Since *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable, use the pipe (|) character followed by async. This identifies Angular's AsyncPipe and subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have to do so in the component class. -->
    <!-- component class does not subscribe to the heroes$ observable. That's the job of the AsyncPipe in the template. -->
